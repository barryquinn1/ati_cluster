## What is clustering

- Clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning and data mining that involves 
grouping objects into clusters based on their similarities and differences.
- The goal of clustering is to identify patterns or structures in the data that are not  obvious by looking at individual objects.

## Clustering in Finance
- Clustering problems appear naturally in various fields, including finance, where they  can be used to identify groups of customers with similar investment preferences or  behaviors, or to segment financial markets based on their characteristics.

- In finance, clustering can be applied at every step of the investment process, from  analysing customer data to identifying profitable trading opportunities.
